# uc-java-more-exercises

More Java programming exercises I completed during my second year of university, focusing on mathematical operations, condition checks, loops, and user input.

Topics include:
1. Sum and average of a set of integers
2. Circle circumference and area calculation
3. Multiple of 5 checker
4. Celsius to Fahrenheit converter
5. Integer reversal using loops

TL;DR: Java console apps, math operations, input/output, basic logic

Instructions: 
Just download the .zip file, 
then open Eclipse and go to File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace to import it, 
or simply drop the folder into your Eclipse workspace.
